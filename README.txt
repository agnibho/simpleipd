			=========

SimpleIPD is a web application for paperless management of hospital admitted
patients.

SimpleIPD is written in PHP and Javascript. It uses SQLite databases for storing
data.

The primary motivation behind creating SimpleIPD is to transition to a paperless
system with minimal disruption to the workflow. To this end, SimpleIPD closely
adheres to the natural workflow in a traditional hospital.

The system is primarily designed with small hospitals in mind with tightly
integrated departments.

All data is centrally hosted and is focused on fast and convenient operations
while attempting to keep the complexity to a minimum.

If used in multiple hospitals, each hospital will need a separate server
installation.
